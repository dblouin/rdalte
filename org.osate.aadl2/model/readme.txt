aadl2-noumlgenmodel has statements removed regarding the origin of the ecore model from UML@. 
It had caused problems with Xtext generation.
Xtext refers to it rather than the original.
NOTE: Needs to be updated whenever the original changes.

Similarly, instance.genmodel is a copy of the original, while genmode.phf has UML2 stuff removed.
