      CeCILL-B FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
Notice
This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the
result of discussions between its authors in order to ensure
compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting:
* firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted
to users,
* secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with
which it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
to both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
The authors of the CeCILL-B1 license are:
Commissariat Ã  l&apos;Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific,
technical and industrial research establishment, having its principal
place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015
Paris, France.
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public
scientific and technological establishment, having its principal
place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16,
France.
Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique
- INRIA, a public scientific and technological establishment,
having its principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau,
Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.
Preamble
This Agreement is an open source software license intended to
give users significant freedom to modify and redistribute the
software licensed hereunder.
The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon a strong obligation
of giving credits for everybody that distributes a software incorporating
a software ruled by the current license so as all contributions
to be properly identified and acknowledged.
In consideration of access to the source code and the rights
to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users
are provided only with a limited warranty and the software&apos;s
author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive
licensors only have limited liability.
In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are
brought to the user&apos;s attention, given its Free Software status,
which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its
use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals
having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged
to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their
requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems
and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate
it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be
freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered,
and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.
This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the
holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof
to its provisions.

that enables supplementary functions or services in addition
to those offered by the Software.

all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence
of possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee&apos;s
attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading,
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software
which are reserved for experienced users.
The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all
means, the suitability of the product for its requirements, its
good working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause
damage to either persons or properties.
9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is
entitled to grant all the rights over the Software (including
in particular the rights set forth in Article 5).
9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as
is&quot; by the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty,
other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular,
without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured,
safe, innovative or relevant nature.
Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software
is free from any error, that it will operate without interruption,
that it will be compatible with the Licensee&apos;s own equipment
and software configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee&apos;s
requirements.
