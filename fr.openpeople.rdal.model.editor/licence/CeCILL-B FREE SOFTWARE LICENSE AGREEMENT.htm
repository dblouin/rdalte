<H1 class=title>CeCILL-B FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT</H1>
<DIV class=notice>
<H2>Notice</H2>
<P>This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of 
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main 
principles guiding its drafting:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free 
  Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users, </LI>
  <LI>secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is 
  conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law, 
  and the protection that it offers to both authors and holders of the economic 
  rights over software. </LI></UL>
<P>The authors of the CeCILL-B<SUP><A 
href="http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html#footnote1">1</A></SUP> 
license are:</P>
<P>Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and 
industrial research establishment, having its principal place of business at 25 
rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.</P>
<P>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and 
technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue 
Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.</P>
<P>Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA, a 
public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of 
business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, 
France.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=preamble>
<H2>Preamble</H2>
<P>This Agreement is an open source software license intended to give users 
significant freedom to modify and redistribute the software licensed hereunder. 
</P>
<P>The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon a strong obligation of 
giving credits for everybody that distributes a software incorporating a 
software ruled by the current license so as all contributions to be properly 
identified and acknowledged. </P>
<P>In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify 
and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited 
warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the 
successive licensors only have limited liability. </P>
<P>In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or 
developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's 
attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, 
with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced 
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged 
to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements 
in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured 
and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. 
This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not 
altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.</P>
<P>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the 
economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.</P></DIV>

<H2>Article <SPAN class=numbering>9 </SPAN>- WARRANTY</H2>
<DIV class=clause>
<P><SPAN class=numbering>9.1 </SPAN>The Licensee acknowledges that the 
scientific and technical state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did 
not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of 
possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's attention has 
been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or 
developing and reproducing the Software which are reserved for experienced 
users.</P>
<P>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the 
suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order, and for 
ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or properties.

<DIV class=clause>
<P><SPAN class=numbering>9.3 </SPAN>The Licensee acknowledges that the Software 
is supplied "as is" by the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, 
other than that provided for in Article <A

its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature. </P>
<P>Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from 
any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will be compatible 
with the Licensee's own equipment and software configuration, nor that it will 
meet the Licensee's requirements. </P></DIV>

<P><SPAN class=numbering>9.4 </SPAN>The Licensor does not either expressly or 
tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any third party intellectual 
property right relating to a patent, software or any other property right. 
Therefore, the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee 
arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in 
respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. 
Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the 
Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. 
Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a case-by-case basis 
between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of 
understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all liability as regards the 
Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the
