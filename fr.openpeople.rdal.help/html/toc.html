<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Requirements Definition and Analysis Language Tool Environment (RDALTE) has been developed by the Lab-STICC research lab at the University of South Britanny
in the frame of the Open-PEOPLE project. It is a set of plug-ins on top of the open source Eclipse platform (www.eclipse.org) that
provides a toolset for front-end processing of RDAL specifications, and for their verification over architecture models. RDAL
specifications are used to contain requirements that together specify at different levels of details what the system to be implemented
should do. Requirements are a very important part of the system under design and are typically created at the very beginning of a project.
The requirements specification says what the system should do, while the system architecture specification says how to do it. In a
standard requirements analysis process, an initial RDAL specification is created to model high level requirements before any system
architecture is defined. As the requirements analysis proceeds, the high level requirements are decomposed into finer requirements. The
development of the requirements specifications is used to drive the design and implementation of the system. Once the requirements are
sufficiently precise, they can be linked to components of the design that intend to verify them. These requirements can be expressed in
terms of formal languages (such as the OMG Object Constraint Language (OCL)) so that properties or structure of the design components
can be check automatically to see if the linked components satisfy the requirement.

The RDALTE front-end allows for creating RDAL specifications with the help of graphical and object tree editors. Dedicated views are
provided to define the design elements that should meet a requirement, and the requirement's expression in terms of natural or
formal languages.
