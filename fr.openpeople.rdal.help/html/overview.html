<h1>Overview</h1>
RDAL (Requirements Definition and Analysis Language) is a formal requirements modeling language developed at Lab-STIC in the frame of the ANR Open-PEOPLE project. RDAL is completely generic and can be used in conjunction with any system architecture modeling language and any formal textual expression language to provide automated verification of requirements in an MDE-based design flow. RDAL is implemented by the extensible open source RDALTE tool (RDAL Tool Environment). It provides a graphical editor for the definition and analysis of requirements in an incremental refinement process, and interpretation modules with dedicated traceability views for automated verification of formal requirements attached to components of the design.
