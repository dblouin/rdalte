	<h1>2.2 	Using the RDAL Object Editor</h1>
	The object editor presents the model in the form of a tree showing the containment hierarchy of object instances of the model.
	It is automatically invoked when the model file (*.rdal) is opened by double-click the file in the project navigator. The object
	editor is used in conjunction with the property editor to set the properties of the selected element in the tree. New elements are
	created by right-clicking an element in the tree, selecting	"New Child" (or "New Sibling") and the type of element to be created
	(Figure 13).<br><br>
